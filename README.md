# startpage
![Screenshot](/screenshot.png)
This is a startpage that I use for my homepage when my browser opens.
It's kind of bland, but you can change the colors and the background to match your computer.

You can add links and categories specific to what you need/use on a daily basis.

Save the file somewhere on your computer along with the stylesheet and javascript in the same directory.
To set as default page in Firefox: 
  1. go to about:preferences in the search bar
  2. Search "home"
  3. In the textbox next to "Homepage and new windows" type the filepath to the startpage.html file
  4. ex. something like file:///home/user/start_page_directory/startpage.html
